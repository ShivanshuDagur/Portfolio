1.Instance:

The new operator instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory. ...
Note: The phrase "instantiating a class" means the same thing as "creating an object." When you create an object, you are
creating an "instance" of a class, therefore "instantiating" a class.

4.Instance Variable

Here we will learn about instance variables in Java with the help of an example. Instance variables are used
by Objects to store their states. Variables which are defined without the STATIC keyword  and are Outside 
any method declaration are Object specific and are known as instance variables. They are called so because 
their values are instance specific and are not shared among instances.
eg:
public class example{
public int instanceVariable1;
private string instanceVariable2
}

*Instance Variable can not be abstract.
*Instance Variable can not have synchroonized modifier.
*Instance Variable can not have strictfp modifier.
*Instance Variable can not have native modifier.
*Instance Variable can not have Static modifier as it will becomes Class level variable.
