/*Question 4

Given the two positive integers p and q, where p < q. Write a program to determine how many kaprekar numbers are there in the range between 'p' and 'q'(both inclusive) and output them.About 'kaprekar' number:

A positive whole number 'n' that has 'd' number of digits is squared and split into 2 pieces, a right hand piece that has 'd' digits and a left hand piece that has remaining 'd' or 'd-1' digits. If sum of the pieces is equal to the number then it's a kaprekar number.

SAMPLE DATA:

INPUT:
p=1
Q=1000

OUTPUT:

THE KAPREKAR NUMBERS ARE:
1,9,45,55,99,297,999

FREQUENCY OF KAPREKAR NUMBERS IS:8*/

â€ƒ
/*Algorithm

Step-1: Enter the limits
Step-2: Run a loop using the entered limits
Step-3: For each number in the range, count the number of digits(d) in it
Step-4: Find the square of the number
Step-5: Now, divide the square in two parts
Step-6: To do this, first store 10 raised to the power d in t
Step-7: For first part, calculate square mod t
Step-8: For second part, calculate square/t
Step-9: Now add the two parts
Step-10: If the sum is equal to the original number then it is a kaprekar number, print it and 
  count it.
Step-11: If the sum is not equal to the original number it is not a kaprekar number
Step-12: Continue the process till all the numbers in the range are checked
Step-13: Display the frequency of kaprekar numbers.
Step-14: End
